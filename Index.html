    <h2> <a id="5"></a> 4) IT Technologies </h2>


    <h4> Hoang -Autonomous vehicles area </h4>

    <div class="">
    <p> <img src="driverlesscar.png" width="700px"></p>
    </div>


    <b> 1) What does it do?</b>

    <p>An Autonomous Driving (AV), also known as a self-driving car or driverless car, robotic car, is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input. A human passenger is not required to take control of the vehicle at any time, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all. Autonomous Driving can help the vehicle go anywhere as a traditional car go and do anything as an experienced driver do. </p>

    <p>Driverless car work defends on sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning systems, and powerful processors. All the information input from the environment will be processed by sophisticated software. This software will help the vehicle run follow traffic rules and navigate obstacles. There are 6 of automation levels that mean how technology interferes with the vehicle: from level 1 working as an assistance tool driver to level 6 full automation without human. </p>

    <p>In present, driverless cars can run in a specific route without any human action, we have seen more and more autonomous elements becomes a part of our everyday driving lives. The autonomous cars in Level 1 to level 3 is quite common nowadays. Even in many high-end models, autonomous driving become a standard of their cars. For example, automatic parking becomes a characteristic of BMW and Mercedes.</p>

    <div class="">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lBqBPgKp7zc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    </div>

    <p>As the software improve day by day and the development of technology and GPS net. Driverless cars in the future will become more convenient and safer. Obviously, the price will come down as technology evolves, all vehicles will be Level 5 fully autonomous in the next future. </p>

    <b>2) What is the likely impact?</b>

    <div class="">
    <p> <img src="xe1.jpg" width="800px"> </p>
    </div>


    <p>Impact for driver</p>

    <p>Autonomous Driving provides increased safety on the road, elimination of driving fatigue, helps drivers being able to sleep during overnight journeys and help people who are not able to drive- due to factors like age and disabilities- could be able to use automated cars as more transport systems. Improving productivity in the workplace as fewer people would have to worry commuting and their stresses.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the fact that people will change to use autonomous driving instead of traditional cars. A lot of people work mainly by vehicle will be affected because of it. To be more specific, people work in delivery services and taxi services can lose their job with the robot.  </p>

    <p>Impact for Road safety</p>

    <p>The improved safety of roads filled with autonomous vehicles. By removing the human element of driving such as emotions, actions and delay in reactions. We can reduce a lot of the majority of traffic accidents today. Truly, as a reposted in 1.8 million testing miles, Google’s self-driving just had 13 accidents and all of them were caused by the other cars. And with the development of technology, their safety rate will be improving day by day.</p>

    <p>Impact for Insurance </p>

    <p>Because of no driver, a lot of insurance policy will be changing for suitable will the new type of cars. For example, they will have insurance for the owner of the vehicle that has errors in the software. A policy cover customers against hacking car software systems.</p>

    <b>3) How will this affect you? </b>

    <p>As an IT student, Autonomous Driving opened my mind about how the development of technology nowadays and how technology improves the world we live in now. Furthermore, researching this field help me find out that Autonomous Driving is a potential area that I should study.</p>

    <p> As a driver, I see Autonomous Driving as the most convenient and important technology for vehicles. A driverless car can help me more freely and safely than a traditional car. If I am tired and cannot control the vehicle, the driverless car can safety run by driveling itself.</p>

    <h4> Quan - Robots </h4>

    <div class="">
    <p> <img src="robots1.png" width="700px"></p>
    </div>


    <b> 1) What does it do? </b>

    <p> Robots are related to a scientific term, robotics which refers to a compilation of science, technology and engineering. It is a machine-produced to replace human actions in any possible way. Most people understand or first heard about robots through the introduction in films and books such as Wall-E, Robocop and R2-D2. These concepts of robots in the movies might seem unrealistic and impossible to create at first, but with technologies nowadays, anything is possible in the future.</p>

    <p>For robots to work, it must be created using complex technologies and innovative developments. Many types of robots existed in the industrial world, but in general, robots require electrical components to operate and power the machinery. Another way of saying this is like the need for a battery in a TV remote control so that it can be switch on or change TV channels. The components of robots are somewhat very similar to human beings ones as they also need a muscle system, a brain system, a body structure, a sensor system and a power source (Harris n.d.). Some might say robots are the replica of humans, where the only thing they differentiate from humans is feelings and emotions. In terms of technologies being used, these comprise artificial skins, muscles, nose, BioTac sensor, and elastic cable (George 2012).  </p>

    <p>In the present day, robots have been contributing to the operation of many businesses around the world. According to research done in 2005, 90% of robots are used to assemble cars in the automotive industry (Built In n.d.). It is the most common industry for robots to be implemented where a robotic arm is invented to put different parts of the car together. These types of robots are called autonomous robots where they are created to substitute human works without any pay grade and breaks as it’s more efficient and effective. Another industry that uses robots is the agricultural industry where a similar type of flying drone is navigated by a person from afar to identify types of plants as well as feeding them. In this case, the robots are called teleoperated robots, where it is operated by humans to carry out difficult tasks in extreme conditions. </p>

    <p>Moreover, the most recent type of robots that have been trending all over the world and bring a shock to people’s face is humanoid robots. It refers to a machine that is build to copy human’s behaviour and perform similar tasks such as crying, laughing, running jumping and carrying objects. An example of this type of robot is Sofia, the first robot announced and confirmed as a citizen of Saudi Arabia (Built In n.d.).  </p>

    <div class="">
    <p> <img src="robotsophia.jpg" width="500px"></p>
    </div>

    <p>As we all know what robots are capable of right now in the world, imagine in a few years, what else can they do? They already conquered and made a positive impact in the business industry, hence there would be no surprises if they ended changing the way education, security, entertainments and our lifestyle operates. An example of the influence of robots in education is humanoid robots teaching and connecting with students from all over the world (Buckler 2018). A single teacher couldn’t focus on more than one students learning process and journey, whereas the robots can assist and guide each student to bring out the best of themselves in school.</p>

    <p>An example of robots improving security might be facial recognition and drone footage to identify criminals (Buckler 2018). As a result, it's assisting all the cops and detectives in bringing in the criminal quicker, hence reducing all the crimes in general and making the world a safer place. In terms of entertainment and lifestyles, virtual reality will be introduced in our everyday lives where our voice would control the house through voice activation. </p>

    <b>2) What is the likely impact?</b>

    <div class="">
    <p> <img src="robotarms.jpg" width="700px"></p>
    </div>

    <p>With the revolutionising of robots, it can both impact people's lives positively and negatively. Typically, in businesses, the use of robots affects them positively as there is more work done, leading to an increase in productivity, hence achieving the business’s profitability. Workers sometimes carry out the task in an unproductive manner when they get demotivated or bored with their current job, which will slow down the production process and affect negatively on the sales of the business. Therefore, there are no doubts that robots will improve business operations towards the achievement of business objectives. </p>

    <p>However, with the robots introduced in the workplace, the people that are affected the most are the factory workers where their assembling tasks are replaced by robotic arms to carry out the job instead as it’s more cost-effective and productive. Disagreements in the workplace occurred when the employees feel like they are no longer needed in the business and hence causes the unemployment rate of the world to increase. Another way of saying this is the employees are made redundant and are forced to resign from the company to find a job elsewhere. Soon in the workplace, there would be no sign of a human being where the whole factory would consist of robots army assembling different components to finalise the product.  </p>

    <b>3) How will this affect you? </b>

    <p>For myself, the implementation of robots in my own home and everyday life would somewhat affect positively in the short term. I no longer need the install of switches or appearance of remotes anymore as I only need my voice to control and operate the whole house. In terms of security, my family and I would be more protected as there is a facial recognition system installed so that no strangers or thefts can enter in or out of the house without alarms or alerts straight to the police. Everything would become more accessible and more convenient, and everyone in my family could be relieved and live their lives to the fullest. </p>

    <p>However, in the long term, it might negatively affect my daily life when the voice activation would oppose me with system malfunction and the whole system hacked by thieves and hackers. Another disadvantage would be my family and I becoming too dependent on the use of voice activation and refusing to stay active and healthy, both physically and mentally. Therefore, I’m not quite sure with the overall implementation of robots in my everyday life as it could result in some unforeseen consequences. As for myself, I hope the use of robots would be used wisely and appropriately to grow our community and take part in making the world a better place.  </p>




    <h4> HyunMin - Blockchain and cryptocurrencies </h4>

     <b> 1) What does it do? </b>
     <p> From self-driving cars to daily necessities such as smartphones and artificial intelligence robots, the electronic devices, computers, and machines we use are intelligently handling and functioning. Thanks to the "things" that have become smarter, our lives have become more pleasant and faster, and literally more comfortable.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that machine learning is being used in most areas, including computer science. From computer vision (text recognition, face recognition), to speech recognition and handwriting recognition, information search and search engine, bioinformatics (genetic analysis, disease diagnosis), computer graphics and games (animation, virtual reality), and robotics (pathways exploration, unmanned vehicles) are being applied in many places. </p>

<p>The impact of AI that adopt a machine learning skill on companies will depend on industries, organizations and customers. Stephen Prentiss Gartner, a fellow and vice president, cited a lawyer who had to spend a long period of time in education and training. Companies that employ lawyers should pay each lawyer an appropriate level of salary and allowance to cover the training costs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, smart machines to replace lawyers also require a long, costly training period. However, for smart machines, after the first one, the company can introduce additional smart machines at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p>Financial services are also industries where tasks such as loan handling and insurance damage assessment can be automated. The AI is expected to hurt employment in some industries. However, Gartner predicts that while AI and automation in most industries handle regular and repetitive tasks, existing personnel will be able to spend more time raising service levels and dealing with more complex tasks. In addition, many other industries are expected to benefit from the lowered level of stress in high-tension work environments.</p>

<p>Vice President Stephen Prentiss said AI and humans will ultimately have different differences, saying AI is very well-defined and best at solving narrow problems, while humans are good at defining problems that need to be solved and solving complex problems. AI and humans also have a variety of knowledge and skills, and can solve problems in various ways. They can collaborate with each other, and humans can adapt to such changes if the situation changes significantly.</p>



<b>2) What is the likely impact?</b>

<p> Of the numerous potentials that machine learning has, perhaps the biggest impact on the financial market. Machine learning helps determine the bank's optimal location.Information is like gold in the 21st century, and Big Data applications use it to deliver things that are really important to customers. And when it comes to financing, gathering information about all customers is a must. The most common example of this is the process of general operation in ATMs. The purpose of the bank is to process the information received for all operations and immediately perform normal operations with a single button without a search and number on the next visit.Information obtained using Big Data can be used to create and operate engines that determine the optimal location for physical banks. Financial institutions collect information about the most visited areas in the city, when to visit these areas, stores where customers go, and the largest and smallest number of customers. This makes it easy to choose the most profitable place to open a bank. You'll agree that this is a good opportunity. Because location is very important for future success.</p>

<p>Machine learning converts algorithm trading into intelligent trading.Algorithm trading is a kind of transaction that uses software to place transaction orders according to predetermined transaction criteria, such as considering time, price and volume of transactions. Algorithm trading allows trading without human intervention.However, machine running technology provides new and diverse tools to further automate algorithm trading. In the case of machine running, algorithms chase the goal of learning different algorithms, or rules, to advance based on data, such as minimizing predictive errors. Machine learning algorithms are designed to analyze past market behavior and determine optimal market strategy to make trading forecasting more accurate.</p>

<p>Machine learning manages risks and prevents fraud. These are the two topics that banks are most interested in now, which is why these projects were first addressed with innovative technologies such as analysis, machine learning and big data. Banks calculate risk factors and all possible options for scammers and drop them the moment suspicions arise. The main advantage of a fraud detection system by machine learning is that it actively learns and coordinates new potential security threats beyond following a checklist of risk factors. The system can use machine running to detect unique activity or anomalies and present them to the security team. The challenge for these systems is to avoid situations in which signals of risk, not risk, appear from the beginning.</p>

<b>3) How will this affect you? </b>

<p>We have been trying to apply machine learning technology to our daily lives. For example, trials are underway in hospitals and clinics around the world, including Australia.</p>

<p>These robots can use eye contact and sensors to communicate and connect emotionally to you to judge your mood.</p>

<p>It costs tens of thousands of dollars, but mass production will make robots cheaper than hiring humans to do that.</p>

<p>Taking health surveys with new patients, answering routine questions such as where to buy coffee and whether to park, providing information on smoking cessation, avoiding flu and improving nutrition absorb the time of health professionals. Social robots can save some of these tasks to nurses.</p>

<p>Australian experiments used programmable robot peppers that looked like humans.</p>

<p>Townsville Hospital nurse Ann Elvin says the study was conducted with fellow nurses at James Cook University in Queensland.</p>

<p>In July and August last year, Pepper was placed in the corner of the emergency room with 16 beds. For about four months, people were able to make reservations with Pepper for a health survey delivered to their health professionals.</p>
 The survey included information about sleeping habits, eating habits, and activities. Patients were given a printout of the collected data. Social robots can also relieve the pressure that health centers experience.</p>

<p>Pressure will increase across all health care services, and people are getting older. Chronic diseases will increase, Morgan said, causing manpower problems to meet these needs.</p>
Hospital robots are used for everyday conversations and are likely to be partners for young and old people. If you are not comfortable enough to talk to someone directly, you may potentially be more comfortable talking to the robot. In rehabilitation, robot training can be performed together while performing the technique. Coach, therapist, companion, rehearsal tool.The robot's computer vision can monitor whether people are taking medication, in trouble, falling, or in the wrong area of the ward. Pepper won't be able to see anyone trying to take their blood pressure in the near future. But you can see Pepper talking to someone about their blood pressure results, said Dr. Robinson. </p>



    <h2> <a id="6"></a> 5) Project Ideas</h2>
    <div class="">
    <p> <img src="CloudComputing.png" width="800px"> </p>
    </div>


    <h3> Background Context: </h3>

    <p>System requirements and hardware are some of the critical factors hamper people from using apps and programs. Nowadays, the prices of technology devices are more and more expensive that required customers to invest so much money for their computers. Some occupations even required their employees to have a strong computer. My IT Team Project is making a proprietary software application for desktop sharing, and the user can use apps and programs without installing it on their computer. In overall, this app can help their users break the limit of hardware and freely enjoy technology. </p>

    <h3> Core Problem:</h3>

    <p> Hardware problem </p>

    <h3> Idea/Solution:</h3>

    <p>A proprietary software application</p>

    <h3> App name: </h3>

    <p> All In One </p>

    <h3>Audience: </h3>

    <p> All computer users</p>

    <h3> How is work?</h3>

    <div class="">
    <p> <img src="cloud.png" width="600px"> </p>
    </div>

    <p> Basically, my all will work as a sharing desktop app, while user a uses my app to use a program, for example, they use my app to use Adobe Premiere. The request for using Adobe Premiere will be spent on the main server. Then from the main server, the signal will move to Workstation. From here the Workstation, the Adobe Premiere will be open and spent back the working screen to the main server and from the main server to the computer of the user. As the circle I given above, this all will received all activities that users do in their devices in the working display screen and give feedback for the main server then from server to Workstation. To be clearer, the users will work with another computer that has Adobe Premiere, their devices just play the role of a screen and receiving user’s interaction, the app just plays the role of a streaming video app.  </p>

    <h3> Design Features:</h3>

    <b>1-Sign up/ Login page in app.</b>

    <p>The initial page when the user opens the app, the user has to login in here to open the app. If users don’t have their account, the app will request users to sign up or create an account in here. Furthermore, the app will have a function to remember the account login that device.</p>

    <b>2-Menu Screen </b>

    <p>The main page of the app is designed as a huge library include a hundred apps.  all the apps will be a group in the major and their functions such as System- Security, Office, Multi-Media, Programming-Design, Applicable Software, Game and, Movie. All the apps will be sorted by the ranking of users in each major.</p>

    <b>3-Confirmation Screen </b>

    <p>While clicking on the app you want to work in, the user will be moved to the confirmation page that asked the user if they want to work in this app or not. </p>

    <b>4-Working Screen </b>

    <p>User will work in the app they want in this page</p>

    <b>5-Supporting Screen </b>

    <div class="">
    <p> <img src="support.jpg" width="800px"> </p>
    </div>

    <p> This page will have a tutorial for newbie and a 24/7 support chatting to answer and support users. Moreover, user can be able to change the app language to another one in this screen  </p>

    <b>Tools and Technologies required </b>

    <p>A big cloud database server</p>

    <p>A Workstation</p>

    <p>A program to transfer information to the server. </p>

    <p>An agreement from many technology companies to allow their products in this app. </p>

    <b>Skills Required </b>

    <div class="">
    <p> <img src="Skills.png" width="800px"> </p>
    </div>

    <p>A huge range of knowledge of cloud computing network and its service</p>

    <p>A wide knowledge about hardware infrastructure, data center facilities and virtualization technologies.</p>

    <p>Programming languages relative to cloud computing such as Python, Java, ASP.NET, PHP and RUBY.  </p>

    <b>Outcome</b>

    <p>Being a helpful and friendly app for low-quality computer’s user.</p>

    <p>Changing the habit of customers while they buy a new device.  They don’t need to buy a powerful computer for their work and a console device for their entertainment, all they need just an app can connect every app they want.</p>




    <h2> <a id="7"></a> 6) Feedback </h2>

    <div class="">
    <p> <img src="feedback.jpg" width="800px"> </p>
    </div>

    <b>Hoang:</b>
    <p>Although one people was left from the start without letting us know and we lost 1 more week to find together and hard communicate in a few first weeks , we could complete this assignment together. Hyun Min showed that he is a good worker people who complete all the tasks received, Quan has some great initiative with research and design website for the group. </p>

    <b>Quan:</b>
    <p>In the first few weeks, our group came across an early obstacle when 1 member of the group decided to leave the group without letting anyone know. However, after we got over that obstacle, our group of 3 members showed good teamwork skills and all of us contributed towards the project together. With Hoang, the leader and of the group, did a fantastic job at delegating roles and tasks for others members to perform, while also contributing heavily towards the project by completing the project idea, interviewing  IT professionals and helping me with the design layout of the website. With Hyun Min, he shows that he's a hard worker when he manages to finish all his tasks on time without any difficulties. </p>

<b>HyunMin:</b>
<p>We realized that the three of us had to proceed, knowing that one member did not participate in the previous tasks. When I first had a hard time carrying out this task, Hoang's guide made it easier to carry it out. Quan also contributed to completing the project by carrying out his duties thoroughly.</p>

    <h2> <a id="8"></a> 7) Group Reflection </h2>
    <div class="">
    <p> <img src="group.jpg" width="600px"> </p>
    </div>
    <b>Altogether</b>

    <p></p>

    <b>Hoang:</b>
    <p>This assignment gives me the very first change of group working in the IT industry and helps me find out how hard to work in a group are. We have a bad start when one person leaving and losing 1 week to contact with each other one. Furthermore, in the next 2 weeks, everything became harder while 2 other members didn’t upload their work and we couldn’t meet offline because of different timetables. The work became deadlock and we couldn’t make a unified opinion in group works. I have to decide to do the IT Works (Interview) and Group project parts by myself. At that time, I had a feeling that we couldn’t finish this assignment but I was wrong. In the 2 final weeks, we had good communication and had a good group work together and finished all the tasks on time. In the end, this assignment helps me have more experience in group working: distribute tasks reasonably, promote each member’s strengths, and manage the time for the deadline.   </p>

    <b>Quan:</b>
    <p>Assignment 2 is the first assignment in Intro to IT that I have participated in working in groups. With this experience, it helps me build my teamwork skills as well as communication skills. As mentioned above, we, unfortunately, were short of one team member when he decided to drop out early at the beginning of the assignment, while also had difficulties getting in contact with other members. Moreover, our group continued to be ineffective when we couldn't meet up outside the class together as each of us had busy schedules. Firstly, I felt terrible that I let Hoang complete the IT works and Group Project by himself as roles weren’t delegated clearly as first. Secondly, for myself, I performed my tasks on time when I finished one area of the IT technology, comparing the ideal jobs, looking at rankings and demands along with designing the web layout. Overall, I'm glad that in the final 2 weeks of the deadline, our group managed to cooperate with perfect teamwork. Coming to an end of the assignment, I realised the process helped me to perform better in groups as well as to work in harmony with one another while encouraging other members to focus on their strengths and most importantly, focus on time management. </p>

    <b>HyunMin:</b>
    <p>We couldn't proceed well with the assignment for 2 weeks after the assignment was given due to contact problems and schedule problems.Because it took a week to contact one member. Hoang also did a project idea and an interview alone. However, for the remaining two weeks, each of us did a good job in his or her field, and as a result, he or she successfully completed the task. What I learned from this assignment is that I need to manage my time more systematically. Also, by working as a group, I was able to do my tasks with a sense of responsibility and learn things that I didn't know from other group members.</p>
